  - Windows: GNU Emacs; LispBox, ClojureBox
  - Linux: source code; LispBox, ClojureBox, Clojure Starter Kit
  - Mac OS X: Aquamacs; ReadyLisp; ClojureBox, 

TODO: get a copy of SLIME
TODO: donwload up to date Clojure
TODO: download up to date Clojure-Contrib
TODO: download up to date swank-clojure
TODO: jochu-clojure mode


TODO: krbmeacs.git:
 - figure out how to bring this to the workshop
 - or have people download it before hand

TODO: get some emacs Reference Cards

TODO: Put much of this into a 'starter kit'?  On one or more Thumb
      Drives that we can pass around?

TODO: Give an Example of my personal workflows:
 - Linux:
  - Using GNU Screen, T0:Emacs, T1:
 - OSX: 


SLIME Walk-through
 - Desribe the relationship between Emacs, slime, and Swank
 - Create a diagram of how these relate

    {{ Emacs [swank client] }} ==> [RPC] ==> {{ [swank server] Lisp Process }}

   These can all be running on your machine, or the lisp process and
   swank server can be running in a completely separate process on
   another machine, even across the internet.

 - Demonstrate this by running a Clojure Proess on my linode and use
   ssh-port forwarding to connect to it from a local Emacs/Slime session.


TODO: Narrative / Examples on Multiple Windows, splitting, resizing
      with the mouse as well as the keyboard.>


Demonstrate all of these: ESHell, Tramp Mode, Artist Mode

Demonstrate vc-mode, make some changes to a file, then C-xv=, and more...
